# ecrit
High-performance editor with a custom writing surface, a la Google Kix

# What?
Ecrit will be a Javascript editor that doesn't use any native HTML editing surfaces, like textarea or input. You will be able to turn any div into an editor, and it will use some form of operational transformation to keep everything in check.

# Why?
I've been working a lot with Google Doc's editor recently, and it seemed interesting.

# How?
Good question...See the docs in the Design folder in this repo.
